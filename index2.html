    <h1>SAMSUNG GALAXY S23</h1>
    <p>The biggest hardware upgrade that comes with the Galaxy S23 series is Samsung's 200MP ISOCELL HP2 sensor, while the S23 and S23+ get the dual PDAF 12MP Ultrawide camera with macro mode abilities from the Ultra, too, but still keep the 50MP main camera sensors of their predecessors</p>
